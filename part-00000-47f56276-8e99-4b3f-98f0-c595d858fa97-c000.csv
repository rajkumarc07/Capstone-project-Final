00092970eddd063aca001b5bb021be5557e47033,R E V I E W Role of red blood cell distribution width as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta- analysis,The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) an indicator of anisocytosis has emerged as a potential tool for risk stratification of critically ill patients with sepsis. Prognostic predictors are of paramount interest for prompt intervention and optimal utilization of the healthcare system in this ongoing context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the utility of RDW in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive screening of electronic databases was performed up to 30th April 2021 after enrolling in PROSPERO (CRD42020206685). Observational studies or interventional studies evaluating the impact of RDW in COVID-19 outcomes (mortality and severity) are included in this meta-analysis. Our search retrieved 25 studies with a total of 18392 and 3446 COVID-19 patients for mortality and disease severity outcomes. Deceased and critically ill patients had higher RDW levels on admission in comparison to survivors and non-severe patients (SMD = 0.46; 95%CI 0.31-0.71; I 2 = 88% and SMD = 0.46; 95%CI 0.26-0.67; I 2 = 60% respectively). In a sub-group analysis of 2980 patients RDW > 14.5 has been associated with increased risk of mortality (OR = 2.73; 95%CI 1.96-3.82; I 2 = 56%). However the evidences is of low quality. A higher level of RDW on admission in COVID-19 patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However further studies regarding the cut-off value of RDW are the need of the hour.,Sundara,Kannan,India

One of the unique adaptations that many viruses have aquired is the compression of the genes in their genomes. In this paper we study a formalized model of gene compression in viruses. Specifically we define a set of constraints that describe viral gene compression strategies and investigate the properties of these constraints from the point of view of genomes as languages. We pay special attention to the finite case (representing real viral genomes) and describe a metric for measuring the level of compression in a real viral genome. An efficient algorithm for establishing this metric is given along with applications to real genomes including automated classification of viruses and prediction of horizontal gene transfer between host and virus.,Mark,Daley,Canada

These cells belong mainly to the monocyte/macrophage lineage. How these cells survive in immune cats is not known. In this study FIPV positive cells were isolated from pyogranulomas and exudates of 12 naturally FIPV-infected cats and the presence of two immunologic targets viral antigens and MHC I on their surface was determined. The majority of the infected cells were confirmed to be cells from the monocyte/macrophage lineage. No surface expression of viral antigens was detected on FIPV positive cells. MHC I molecules were present on all the FIPV positive cells. After cultivation of the isolated infected cells 52 AE 10% of the infected cells re-expressed viral antigens on the plasma membrane. In conclusion it can be stated that in FIP cats FIPV replicates in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage without carrying viral antigens in their plasma membrane which could allow them to escape from antibody-dependent cell lysis. #,E,Cornelissen,Belgium

00033d5a12240a8684cfe943954132b43434cf48,Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by Mass Spectrometry,Background: Amplification of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the gold standard to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the initial outbreak strategies to detect and isolate patients have been important to avoid uncontrolled viral spread. Although testing capacities have been upscaled there is still a need for reliable high throughput test systems specifically those that require alternative consumables. Therefore we tested and compared two different methods for the detection of viral PCR products: rRT-PCR and mass spectrometry (MS). Methods: Viral RNA was isolated and amplified from oro-or nasopharyngeal swabs. A total of 22 samples that tested positive and 22 samples that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR were analyzed by MS. Results of the rRT-PCR and the MS protocol were compared. Results: Results of rRT-PCR and the MS test system were in concordance in all samples. Time-to-results was faster for rRT-PCR. Hands-on-time was comparable in both assays. Conclusions: MS is a fast reliable and cost-effective alternative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from oral and nasopharyngeal swabs.

Therefore we tested and compared two different methods for the detection of viral PCR products: rRT-PCR and mass spectrometry (MS). Methods: Viral RNA was isolated and amplified from oro-or nasopharyngeal swabs. A total of 22 samples that tested positive and 22 samples that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR were analyzed by MS. Results of the rRT-PCR and the MS protocol were compared. Results: Results of rRT-PCR and the MS test system were in concordance in all samples. Time-to-results was faster for rRT-PCR. Hands-on-time was comparable in both assays. Conclusions: MS is a fast reliable and cost-effective alternative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from oral and nasopharyngeal swabs.

000a0fc8bbef80410199e690191dc3076a290117,PfSWIB a potential chromatin regulator for var gene regulation and parasite development in Plasmodium falciparum,"Background: Various transcription factors are involved in the process of mutually exclusive expression and clonal variation of the Plasmodium multigene (var) family. Recent studies revealed that a P. falciparum SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin (PfSWIB) might trigger stage-specific programmed cell death (PCD) and was not only crucial for the survival and development of parasite but also had profound effects on the parasite by interacting with other unknown proteins. However it remains unclear whether PfSIWB is involved in transcriptional regulation of this virulence gene and its functional properties. Methods: A conditional knockdown system \"PfSWIB-FKBP-LID\" was introduced to the parasite clone 3D7 and an integrated parasite line \"PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID\" was obtained by drug cycling and clone screening. Growth curve analysis (GCA) was performed to investigate the growth and development of different parasite lines during 96 h in vitro culturing by assessing parasitemia. Finally we performed qPCR assays to detect var gene expression profiling in various comparison groups as well as the mutually exclusive expression pattern of the var genes within a single 48 h life-cycle of P. falciparum in different parasite lines. In addition RNA-seq was applied to analyze the var gene expression in different lines. Results: GCA revealed that conditional knockdown of PfSWIB could interfere with the growth and development of P. falciparum. The parasitemia of PfSWIB∆ showed a significant decline at 96 h during in vitro culture compared with the PfSWIB and 3D7 lines (P < 0.0001). qPCR and RNA-seq analysis confirmed that depletion of PfSWIB not only silences upsA upsC and partial upsB var genes as well as removes the silencing of partial upsB var genes at the ring stage in PfSWIB∆ line but also leads to aberrant expression of upsA and partial upsB/upsC var genes at the mature stage of P. falciparum during a single 48-h life-cycle. We demonstrated that PfSWIB was involved in the process of clonal variation in var gene expression and crucial for the survival and development of Plasmodium parasite. These findings could provide better understanding of the mechanism and function of PfSWIB contributing to the pathogenesis in malaria parasites.",Wei-Feng,Wang,China
